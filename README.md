**Accountability in Global Governance (AGG) Database**

The Accountability in Global Governance (AGG) dataset measures the strength of formal accountability mechanisms possessed by major international institutions. The dataset covers five types of mechanisms – transparency, evaluation, redress, investigation, and participation mechanisms – and covers 52 significant international institutions between 1960 and 2018. The dataset also includes a number of additional variables that may be of interest to scholars of accountability in global governance, such as institutions’ governance tasks, decision-making procedures, financial resources, and media coverage.

The dataset, which is available in CSV format, was introduced in my article "Making Global Governance Accountable." Please use the following citation:

This repository also contains a codebook that provides a detailed description of all variables in the database, including their definition, scale, and sources.
